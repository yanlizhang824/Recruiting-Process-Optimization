# Recruiting-Process-Optimization

Hi Amrou! Thanks for checking out my project. Here's the descrition of each file's functionality.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

build_model.py: construct a MLP (Multiple-layer Perceptron) model and save it as the model weights.

build_model.ipynb: a Notebook version of "build_model.py" where you can see the trainning process and the evaluation metrics. 

mlp_model.h5: the saved model weights.

preprocess_for_prediction.py: clean and pre-process the dataset before loading the model and making the prediction.

main.py: load the model weight and run the prediction process on the Gradio Interface.
